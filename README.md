# Chapter-1


### Code Overview:

To ensure a seamless reproduction of the results discussed in the chapter, follow the guide below:

**Repository Structure**:
- The repository is organized into four distinct branches:
  1. `main`: Contains all the implemented techniques.
  2. `baseline`: Implements the baseline technique discussed.
  3. `reward_shaping`: Focuses on the reward shaping technique.
  4. `action_shielding`: Highlights the action shielding technique.

**Steps to Run the Code**:
1. Navigate to the `main.m` script.
2. Configure the desired number of agents you wish to simulate.
3. Execute the script.
4. Once completed, gather key flight statistics, including NMAC and Computation time.
5. Save your environment as a `.mat` file.
6. To visualize the results, import the saved `.mat` file into the `animate.m` script and run it.
